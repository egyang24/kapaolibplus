============
This is a repository of telemetry visualization tools and notebooks for KAPAO, the Pomona Adaptive Optics project. The file AnalysisTemplateConsolidated.ipynb is an IPython Notebook that gives X Slope, Y Slope, Intensity, and DM Position visualizations in a heatmap grid format, as well as tip/tilt as a function of time and pinned actuators as a function of time. The heat maps can be interacted with. The file TelemVisualizer provides the same plots but without the interactive feature, but it can be run on machines that don't have the IPython Notebook.
